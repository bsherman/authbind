authbind (2.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  Bugfix:
  * 0-length ipv4 address masks (ie, 0.0.0.0/0) in byuid files wouldn't
    work because they would attempt a 32-bit shift.  This was reported
    against Ubuntu in Launchpad but the but is here too.  LP: #514278.

    Explain the problem more clearly in the manpage.  (Closes: 654706.)
